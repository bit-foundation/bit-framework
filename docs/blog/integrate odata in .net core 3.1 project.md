# Integrate OData in .Net Core 3.1 Project With Just 20 Lines of Codes!

Duo to the announcement of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData V7.4`, I decided to prepare an article to demonstrate how to use OData in ASP.NET Core 3.1+ projects with minimal changes in the code, so you can see how much it became easy to use in new versions. This approach is valid for projects that have `endpoint routing` which is the recommended approach.

First with `dotnet --version` or `dotnet --info` commands or any other methods, we should be sure about installation of dot net core 3.1+ sdk. Then we execute the below command:

```csharp
dotnet new webapi -o SampleApi
```

In Visual Studio, this command is equivalent to creating a new ASP.NET Core Web API project. This project uses endpoint routing. There are a `WeatherForecast` model and `WeatherForecasetController` with a `Get` action that creates and returns a list of WeatherForecasts. This project doesn't involve any database.

So what should we do to make this project OData enabled?

1- Install these two packages:
```markup
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson" Version="3.1.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData" Version="7.4.0" />
```
2- Open `Startup.cs` file and modify the `ConfigureService` as below:
```csharp
services.AddControllers().AddNewtonsoftJson(); // Add .AddNewtonsoftJson() to services.AddControllers();
services.AddOData(); // add this new line
```
Also modify `app.UseEndpoints` line in `Configure` method as below:
```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => // Existing code
{
    endpoints.MapControllers(); // Existing code
    endpoints.EnableDependencyInjection(); // Add this new line
    endpoints.Select().Expand().Filter().OrderBy().Count().MaxTop(20); // Add this new line
});
```
Then modify the `Get` action in `WeatherForecastController` as below:
```csharp
// replace:
[HttpGet] // Existing code
// with:
[HttpGet, EnableQuery] // new code
```
Run the app and go to this address:
http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast?$orderby=TemperatureC

The `orderby=TempratureC` phrase causes the WeatherForcast result items to be ordered by their temperatures when sending them to the client.

As you can see, we easily added OData to our sample app.
Generally, OData is capable of filtering records, projection, ordering, paging, grouping, aggregations, etc. We will see some provided examples in the next section.
We will use a list of `customers` instead of the ASP.NET Core default `WeatherForcast` model because it's a little vague.
```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public Gender Gender { get; set; }

    public AddressInfo Address { get; set; }
}

public class AddressInfo
{
    public int StreetNo { get; set; }

    public string PostalCode { get; set; }
}

public enum Gender
{
    Man, Woman, Other
}
```
For returning only women customers: *(Filtering on Enum)*
```csharp
?$filter=Gender eq 'Woman'
```
To ordering woman clients based on their address street number: *(Ordering on nested properties and combination of orderby and filter clauses)*
```csharp
?$filter=Gender eq 'Woman'&$orderby=Address/StreetNo
```
To get customers with Ali in their names:
```csharp
?$filter=contains(FirstName,'Ali')
``` 
To see more querying examples in OData check out [this link](https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/#queryData). 
There are a lot of querying capabilities including Any/All in the filter query provided by OData.

In addition, if we provide an IQueryable for OData instead of an array or list, the OData will execute the queries of paging, orderby, etc against the database and only the final result will return from the database, therefore it will have a huge effect on application performance.

The security in this method will not be in danger, because if you put a where on the server-side query or any kind of row level security, based on app logic, the client only can (OData) query on the limited with where applied data, so it can fetch only accessed data from the database.

All of the above concepts can be applied without any changes in `app routing`, `Swagger`, etc, so you can use your best practices like using `Dto` instead of raw `Entity` along with OData features.
